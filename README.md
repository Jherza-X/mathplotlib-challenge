Analisis
1. We have an even distribution between the mouse genre, approximately 50 female and %50 male, as the pie chart shows.
2. The box plot by treatment group indicates that for Capomulin and Ceftamin, most of the population's tumor volume maintains below the median. Meanwhile, Infubinol and Ramicane hold an even number. 
3. The box plot shows that Capomulin and Ramicane maintain the lower tumor volume population. Rather, Ceftamin shows the most spread population regarding  the tumor volume. Finally,one outlier case is shown for Infubinol. As a result, Capomulin and Ramicane offer the most effective treatments. 
4. The line and scatter plot analysis for Capomulin confirms the past statement. Choosing a random mouse to plot the evolution of its tumor volume over the time graphs shows a fast decrement over time. This fact was confirmed by plotting ten mice (you can print a chart of each mouse at a time).
5. In the correlation analysis over average tumor and weight, the calculation of the Pearson coefficient shows a strong correlation between these two values. In the linear regression analysis, I found a positive correlation with a line with a positive slope that indicates an increment of the average tumor volume as the weight increases. This fact suggests that overweight mice tend to have a more considerable tumor volume on average.
6. In conclusion, the Capomulin treatment positively affects the treated mice population. And the weight is an essential fact that should be considered when analyzing and selecting mice populations.
